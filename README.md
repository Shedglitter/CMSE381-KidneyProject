The dataset depicts 203 patients with kidney diseases, and the variables represented primarily concentration of particulate in urine. The primary questions to answer are whether it is possible to predict chronic kidney disease given a certain concentation in the urine sample and whether other extraneous factors, such as age affect the likelihood of ckd, and which, if any, variable has the strongest relationship to ckd. Our first step will be cleaning the data, where ranged variables will be expressed as two different variables and variables currently expressed as <x or >x just expressed as a single x. Our next step is doing a linear regression of the ckd binary variable against all other variables in order to observe any possible pattern and also regress a different variable as parameter selection. The next step is probably KNN, though an alternate method is not opposed.

timeline: clean code by end of fall break - create and plot regression by end of next week - try and get knn done by beginning of november - get presentation filmed week after thanksgiving
