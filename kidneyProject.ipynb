    "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) as of 2024 affects 9.1% of population worldwide accounting to about 737 million individuals [1]. CKD is a progressive condition characterized by decline in kidney function leading to increased risk of various disease including cardiovascular disease, kidney failure and premature death. Despite the prevalence of this disease, CKD often remains underdiagnosed making methods for early detection crucial [2]. \n",
    "\n",
    "Data sceince has the potential to serve as powerful tool that can serve as a predictive tool for CKD. With the use of large datasets, it is possible to uncover patterns and relationships that may not be immediately apparent, but can serve as a tool for early diagnosis and thus, early intervention for CKD.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to leverage tools to develop and evaluate models that can accurately predict the presence/progression of CKD. **Include more explicit detail about what other than predicting presence of CKD we will be doing** With successful use of these models, the hope is for practical application of data-driven methods to early diagnosis and intervention of CKD to improve patient outcomes and decrease health burdens.
